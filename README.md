# Refraktor

Refraktor is a general-purpose Chrome extension that discovers the [WebMCP](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webmcp)
tools a page registers and lets you drive them from a Gemini-powered chat in the side
panel. Point it at any WebMCP-enabled site; it reads whatever tools that page exposes.
There is nothing hard-coded to one site. 

[Refraktor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/refraktor/nkafbaaanaamfjdljndmieichdgkhgii) is available via the Chrome Web Store.

## How it works

```
page (MAIN world)        extension
  bridge.js  ──postMessage──▶ content.js ──chrome.runtime──▶ background.js ──▶ side panel
  reads modelContext           (isolated relay)                (message hub)      (chat + Gemini loop)
```


## Try it (against sirocco.gallery)

Visit `https://sirocco.gallery/session`. The badge should show **5**. Then ask:

- "What palettes do you have?" → `list_instruments`
- "Recommend something for a dark financial dashboard" → `recommend_instrument`
- "Check this CSS: `.card { background: #1a1a1a; border-radius: 8px; }` against
  instrument 002" → `check_design_drift`

The agent chains calls on its own and summarizes the result.

## Constraints (v0.1)

- **BYO Gemini key** — the extension ships no key.
- **General-purpose** — tool names, schemas, and behavior are all discovered at
  runtime; the extension knows nothing site-specific.
- **Chrome flag required** — WebMCP is still behind a flag (see Install).
- **`activeTab` by default, not `<all_urls>`** — out of the box the extension only
  touches a page when you click its toolbar icon; it has no standing access to your
  browsing. Trade-off: a navigated page needs another click to re-scan. Flip on
  **"Scan pages automatically"** (optional `<all_urls>` grant) to get auto-scan on every
  page back.

## Verified

Across two independent providers in Chrome:

- **sirocco.gallery** (5 read-only tools): discovery; no-arg, single-arg, and multi-arg
  calls (`check_design_drift` → named color/radius drift); multi-turn memory.
- **A consultation-booking demo** (second provider): discovery; a read tool
  (`getAvailability`, two typed date args); two **state-mutating action tools**
  (`bookSlot` with four args → confirmation, then `cancelBooking`) — with the model
  carrying a `confirmationId` from one tool's result into the next, and parsing a
  name/email from conversational input.

  ## Deployment and Infrastructure
  [[Deployed with Vercel](https://vercel.com)](https://sirocco-gallery.vercel.app/)
  
  The sirocco.gallery WebMCP provider surface is optimized for serverless architeture and deployed globally via Vercel. It leverages Vercel's capabilities to
  instantly stream responses for its five callable tools during the Google Chrome Canary WebMCP origin trial.
